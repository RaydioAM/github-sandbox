# Markdown Test File

This file will be for testing how certain Markdown things render in GitHub.

### Test 1 - Copyable Code Block

```
GitHub does not provide this information for redistribution or resale to any entity. We do make limited exceptions for third party platforms providing security and privacy information to GitHub's existing customers, so long as the provider either (1) has entered into a Non-Disclosure Agreement with Microsoft governing the information to be provided, or (2) clearly states in its public terms of service that the information provided will not be re-distributed to anyone beyond the GitHub customer requesting the information.

It does not appear **[INSERT COMPANY NAME]** has a Non-Disclosure Agreement with Microsoft, and **[CELA to confirm if required: _"we were unable to location language in your terms of service that limited the scope of re-distribution."_]**

We require you to agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in your terms or elsewhere, **[INSERT COMPANY NAME]** will not sell, license, or otherwise redistribute in any manner the information GitHub provides, except to existing GitHub customers. By replying to this email with your agreement to this limitation, you represent that you have authority to bind **[INSERT COMPANY NAME]** to it.
```

#### Outcome

GitHub doesn't do wrapping inside of codeblocks. Decisions will need to be made on if it's better to see all of the text or to have the quick copy functionality.
